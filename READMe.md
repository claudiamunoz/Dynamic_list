This Dynamic List was created by Kimberly and Claudia. If you need to go shopping, this list is the perfect solution to organize all the things you need. You can add items. If you change your mind or if you bought the item, you can easily delete it by clicking the delete button. We used git hub and trello to organize our thoughts and steps. Our trello can be accesed through: https://trello.com/b/9veYZvoQ/dynamic-list
